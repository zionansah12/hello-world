    <h3>Steph str8 killin the game and yall know that!!!</h3>
    <p>
       Stephen Curry put an exclamation point on an otherworldly season Wednesday night, pouring in 46 points as the Warriors secured their 73rd win, one-upping the 72-10 mark set by Jordan’s Bulls.

In scoring those 46 points — which he did on 24 shots (Kobe Bryant took 50 to score 60 points in his farewell game Wednesday night) — and setting a record for wins, Curry also established a new league high for three-pointers made, as he canned 10 to give him 402 on the season.

Four-hundred-two!

      bottom line if you say Steph garbage then chances are that you're trash and nothing more.

    <h2>I can't wait to learn CSS!</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be of great use when learning to lay out and format the look of my web page.  I am looking forward to learning this and many other things as I continue in the Exploring STEM Careers Pipeline Program!
